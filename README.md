These notebooks are the notebooks we used for exploratory data analysis, the creation of our Random Forest models, the creation of our LSTM models, the testing of our hyperparameters, and our error_analysis and significance testing 

> base_significance_testing.ipynb: Holds creation of our base model, creation of wilcoxon tests for significance
> 
> data_cleaning_eda.ipynb: Holds our data cleaning and EDA work 
> 
> random_forest.ipynb: Holds our TF-IDF vectorization, sampling techniques, hyper-parameter tuning and error analysis for Random Forest
> 
> word2vec_random_forest.ipynb: Holds the creation of the custom word2vec model and creation of Random Forest with that model 
> LSTM + GloVe.ipynb: Holds data splitting, tokenization, batch generation, model training, loss & validation f1 score plotting, and scores (F1, precision, recall) calculation
